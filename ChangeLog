gtk-vector-screenshot (0.3)

  * Uses code from xwininfo to reliably find the right X window, even with
    window managers such as metacity.
  * Smaller Save-As dialogue even with large application windows.
    Help getting this dialogue right with regard to sizing and resizing would
    be appreciated!
