gtk vector screenshot module
============================

© 2011 Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>

This gtk module allows you to take a screenshot of a running gtk-3 application
as a vector image, with fully scaleable graphics and selectable text. It
supports rendering the application to PDF, SVG and PostScript.

Usage
=====

You have to load the gtk-vector-screenshot module when starting the
application:

GTK_MODULES=gtk-vector-screenshot appname

Besides the application window, another window with one button will appear. If
you click on that button, you can select the filename to save the image under.


You can watch a screencast of the program in action at

BUGS and TODOs
==============
 * It only works with gtk3 applications.
 * The screenshot is taken the moment you press Save in the file chooser
   dialogue, not when you press the “Take vector screenshot” button.
 * The screenshot is taken of the first top level window found. If there are
   more of them, there is no way to select any.
 * The Save As dialogue should remember the filename
